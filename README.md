# P7-1: Neighborhood Map Project
Responsive single-page application featuring a map of Chicago lakefront and showcasing some local museums.

##Intro
This is my Neighborhood Map Project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This was project 5 when I started the program, but is now numbered 7.1. I feel this was the most challenging project to date. I have learned a lot, but completing it took me much longer than I care to admit. I have not taken the Writing READMEs course yet.

##About
This is a responsive single-page application featuring a map of Chicago lakefront and showcasing some local museums. Functionality includes a search field to filter the museum listing and corresponding map markers, and also allows to make museum selection directly, from sidebar navigation or by clicking on map markers. Once a museum is selected, application asynchrously requests and displays information about the museum.

The application uses Model-View-Octopus, aka Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern and Knockout.js library for data binding, which is a really elegant way to create a dynamic user interface.

##APIs used
The application uses Google Maps API and MediaWiki web API:

##How to run
Open index.html in your browser.
